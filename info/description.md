Let's play with pearls.
To start the game, robots put several black and white pearls in one of the boxes.
For each move, the robots take a pearl out of the box and put one of the opposite color back.
The winner is the one who pulls the white pearl on the **Nth** step.

Our robots don't like indeterminacy and want to know the probability of a white pearl on the Nth step.
The probability is a value between 0 (0% chance or will not happen) and 1 (100% chance or will happen).
The result is a float from 0 to 1 with two digits precision (&plusmn;0.01).

You are given a start set of pearls as a string that contains 
"b" (black) and "w" (white) and the number of the step (N).
The order of the pearls does not matter.
